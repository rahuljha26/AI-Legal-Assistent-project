# @opencoredev/convex-email

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- e555af3: Support every built-in Email SDK adapter in the Convex component, including Lettermint, JetEmail, and Primitive.

  Adapter configuration is now driven by a single registry (`src/shared/adapters.ts`) that declares each adapter's options, default environment variables, and which fields may be set inline. The wire validators, the `ConvexEmailAdapterConfig` union, the component's declared environment, and runtime option resolution are all derived from that registry, so a new adapter needs one registry entry plus one factory line rather than four parallel edits.

  The wire format is unchanged for existing adapters. `LOOPS_TRANSACTIONAL_ID` is now declared in the component environment, so the Loops adapter can actually read it.

### Minor Changes

  Ship the component alongside a patch SDK release so the docs, package entrypoints, and provider surface move forward as `0.6.1` instead of a larger version jump.
